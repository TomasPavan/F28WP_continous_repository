# F28WP_continous_repository
This repository is for the F28WP course.


# The idea
The idea behind the repository is to implement a website that incorporates a website that dispalys a wide variatey of coffee recipes from different well known coffee shops. 
It also displays the coffee of the day with an explanation to why it is the coffee of the day.
